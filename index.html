            <br>
            The final design of the project "Representations of Personal Data" is a series of 
            data visualizations combined. Each data visualization represents a different 
            perspective of viewing the data. The left side of the final design are two heatmaps 
            showing the total messages sent and received in 2023 and 2022, with darker color 
            representing more messages. On the right, the first visualization shows a pie chart 
            of different message types in the chat history, with the percentages next to each slice. 
            The second visualization on the right shows the total messages in the chat history over 
            time, so that I have a general overview of when did we chat the most. Then the third 
            visualization goes into details on the messages sent and received in 2023 specifically, 
            since we chat the most in 2023. Lastly, the last visualization on the right shows the 
            total number of messages sent and received fpr each hour, so that I can see which hour 
            did my friend and I chat the most. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For this project, I used an unconventional format of my data since usually when people 
            think of chat history, they would only calculate the number of messages chatted in a time 
            period, and use a line chart to show different numbers. For my project, instead of a line 
            chart, I used a heatmap so that I can visualize the number of messages in a year more clearly, 
            and also see right to the point of which day did we chat the most, which is the darkest color on 
            the heat map. The last visualization on the right used data parameters that people do not 
            usually use to analyze their chat history, but I thought it would be a good way to see which 
            time in a day did my friend and I have the most conversation. The other three data visualizations 
            are comparably more common for people to analyze, but I also put these visualizations in the design 
            to make the story more complete, and people could have a whole picture of me and my friend's chat analysis.

    <section id="data_collection">
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>For the data collection process of my project, I exported me and my friend's chat history from the 
            app WeChat. I searched online on the chat export tools and found a <a href="https://github.com/LC044/WeChatMsg">Github page</a> 
            that lets me export the chat history. The following image shows the exported file. There are a total 
            of 22296 messages from 2021/12/05 to 2024/02/29. I added a column G to the file to extract the date in 
            yyyy/mm/dd format without the time, and also added a column H to extract the time of the message with only 
            the hour as xx o'clock. 
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="export.png" alt="Data collection" width="70%">
    </section>

    <section id="process">
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>With the data file, I created 5 different visualizations. The first visualization shows the percentage of 
            the message types in the chat history. When exported the data, each message has a message type as number 
            (column A), I calculated each message types using the COUNTIF function and calculated the percentage of 
            each type of message. Then I sorted the types from the highest to the lowest, and made a pie chart showing 
            the percentage of each type of messages. 
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <div class="image123">
            <img src="message types.png" alt="Message Types" width="40%" style="float:left">
            <img src="pie chart.png" alt="Pie Chart" width="53%">
        </div>
        <p>
            <br>
            Since the exported data also contains a “isSender” parameter that shows whether the message was sent by me in the 
            left image below, I used these values to create another table that shows the number of messages sent and received 
            by me for each day, in the right image below. 
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <div class="image123">
            <img src="isSender.png" width="24%" style="float:left">
            <img src="SentReceived.png" width="30%">
        </div>
        <p>
            <br>
            With this table, I created a chart showing the messages sent and received over time, as well as the total messages, shown 
            as the first image below. But since the lines are overlapping too much, and has too many spikes, I iterated over it and 
            decided to use only the total messages for this chart, shown as the second image below. 
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <div class="image123">
            <img src="total message 1.png" width="100%">
            <br>
            <img src="total message 2.png" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p>
            <br>
            Then I created another table that shows specifically the number of messages received and sent in each month in 2023, since 
            I became closer with my friend in 2023 and had more chats. I first took out the months for each date in the Month(helper) 
            column, then found the number of messages sent and received in each month using the function below. 
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="month send.png" width="50%">
        <p>
            <br>
            Then I created a monthly messages sent and received in 2023 chart that has all the parameters on it. The messages sent and 
            received lines are more clear than before. I also added the data labels on top of each month for the specific numbers. 
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="Monthly messages sent and received in 2023.png" width="100%">
        <p>
            <br>
            Since I added the column of the hour that each message was sent or received, I used the function to calculate all the messages 
            send and received in each hour.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="hours.png" width="100%">
        <p>
            <br>
            With the table I created, I made a chart that shows the number of messages that I sent and received per hour.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="Message count per hour.png" width="100%">
        <p>
            <br>
            Lastly, I wanted to make a heatmap to visualize the number of messages sent and received in a year. I followed a 
            tutorial online and used Tableau to make 2 heatmaps, in 2022 and 2023, since these are the years that the data are 
            from Jan. to Dec.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <img src="heatmap1.png" width="100%">
        <p>
            <br>
            After making all the tables and charts, I used figma to combine all the charts and uniformed each chart’s title 
            to have the same size and color. 
            <br>
